# MTGenerator
A series of neural networks that generate different portions of Magic the Gathering Cards

## Goals
I plan to continually add to this repository until I have a series of networks that generate each portion of a Magic the Gathering card, including the artwork, name, type, card text, cost, and stats. For now that goal is a long way away, with a lot of network parameter tinkering in my way. It will likely also house experimental networks I write to learn new librarys that utilize the MTG data.
